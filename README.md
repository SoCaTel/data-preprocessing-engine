# SoCaTel Data Processing engine repository

This repository houses two systems. The first facilitates the data pre-processing for the recommendation engine, used to
serve recommendations to users about various SoCaTel resources as well. The second one facilitates the data 
pre-processing for the sentiment analysis engine used to serve analytics about group feelings and and general attitude
towards ideas and services discussed.

To avoid over-cluttering this README file, please go to the `./recommendation_engine/README.md` for instructions on how
to setup data pre-processing for the recommendation engine and likewise to the `./sentiment_classifier/README.md` for 
the sentiment classifier.
